# Required Assets for Welcome Completion Page

## Images Needed:

### `assets/images/food_scan.png`
- **Description**: A photo of a healthy meal (salad bowl with vegetables, eggs, tomatoes)
- **Size**: Recommended 300x300px or higher
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Usage**: Used in the first feature card to demonstrate food scanning functionality
- **Content**: Should show an appetizing, healthy meal that represents the app's target use case

## Current Status:
- The `WelcomeCompletionPage` is coded to use `assets/images/food_scan.png`
- You'll need to add this image file to the assets folder
- Make sure to update `pubspec.yaml` to include the assets path if not already included

## Alternative:
If you don't have the specific food image, you can:
1. Use any food photo as a placeholder
2. Or modify the code to use an icon instead of an image
3. Or use a stock photo of a healthy meal

The code will work once the image asset is provided.
